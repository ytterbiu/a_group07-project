The Nasdaq Composite (`^IXIC`) data was downloaded using the `getSymbols`
command from the `quantmod` library.

)

}

# Download the data

```

First we can prepare our data, getting the adjusted close price, applying a log
transform, calculating the log-return increment, and removing NaN values.

```{r Prepare data}
# get adjusted close price
IXIC_ad <- Ad(IXIC)
# log transform
y_n <- log(IXIC_ad)
# log-return increment (z_n) - get difference in log transformed data
z_n <- diff(y_n)
# remove NA values
z_n <- na.omit(z_n)
```

Let's have a quick look at the data.

```{r initial-visualisation, fig.cap = "Initial visualisation TBC."}
# same length as IXIC_ad, first value NA
z_n_xts <- diff(log(IXIC_ad))

df <- tibble(
  date  = index(IXIC_ad),
  price = as.numeric(IXIC_ad),
  z_n   = as.numeric(z_n_xts)
) %>%
# drops the first row where z_n is NA
  drop_na(z_n)
p1 <- ggplot(df, aes(date, price)) +
  theme_bw() +
  geom_line() +
  labs(
    title = "NASDAQ Composite\n (Adjusted Close)",
    x = "Date", y = "Adjusted Close"
  )

p2 <- ggplot(df, aes(date, z_n)) +
  geom_line() +
  theme_bw() +
  labs(
    title = expression(Log~Return~Increment~(z[n])),
    x = "Date",
    y = expression(z[n])
  )

# gridExtra::grid.arrange(p1, p2, ncol = 2)
(p1 | p2) &
  theme(
    plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5),
    plot.margin = margin(5.5, 5.5, 5.5, 5.5)
  )

```

## Data cleaning and standard test of normality {#elementOne}

### Identifying and removing outliers

We chose to remove data from ... (need to include paragraph here outlining how
we chose the dates used: 2020-03-01/2020-05-31 - BE note: these are placeholder
at the moment just to get the code to work... Something to discuss and justify)

It is suggested that we remove data from the 2020/21 COVID-19 period
($log~x_{20May2020}$ and $log~x_{09Apr2020}$), when markets were heavily
disrupted. The extreme, policy-driven movements in this window can be argued to
not reflect the “normal” behaviour of the IXIC index.

As noted in the assessment instructions, if we delete dates from the dataset, we
cannot then treat the jump between the last date before the gap and the first
date after the gap as a valid increment ($z_n$). Calculating log-returns first
and only afterwards drop rows for the excluded period, our data would contain
incorrect 'links'.

Cleaning has to happen before we compute any returns.

```{r Element 1 pt1 - cleaning}
#---------- Element 1: data cleaning and standard test of normality -----------#

outlier_period <- "2020-03-01/2020-05-31"
# set all values from outlier period to NA
y_n_clean <- y_n
y_n_clean[outlier_period] <- NA
# calculate log-return increments
z_n_clean <- diff(y_n_clean)
z_n_clean_pre_na_drop <- z_n_clean
# remove NA increments
z_n_clean <- na.omit(z_n_clean)
```

Quick visualisation to compare new vs old:

```{r raw-vs-clean, echo=FALSE, fig.cap = "Raw vs clean* TBC"}
df_raw <- tibble(
  date = index(z_n),
  z_n  = as.numeric(z_n)
)
df_clean <- tibble(
  date = index(z_n_clean_pre_na_drop),
  z_n  = as.numeric(z_n_clean_pre_na_drop)
)
ylim_all <- range(df_raw$z_n, df_clean$z_n, na.rm = TRUE)


p_raw <- ggplot(df_raw, aes(date, z_n)) +
  geom_line() +
  theme_bw() +
  scale_y_continuous(limits = ylim_all) +
  labs(
    title = "Log Return Increments\n(pre exclusion)",
    x = "Date",
    y = expression(z[n])
  )

p_clean <- ggplot(df_clean, aes(date, z_n)) +
  geom_line() +
  theme_bw() +
  scale_y_continuous(limits = ylim_all) +
  labs(
    title = "Log Return Increments\n(post exclusion)",
    x = "Date",
    y = expression(z[n])
  )

(p_raw | p_clean) &
  theme(
    plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5),
    plot.margin = margin(5.5, 5.5, 5.5, 5.5)
  )

```

### Sample statistics

<!-- Skewness and excess kurtosis are computed using e1071 with type = 1. -->

Skewness and excess kurtosis of the cleaned log-returns $z_n$ were computed
using the `e1071` package in R with type = 1 [@R-e1071]. This corresponds to the
classical moment-based definitions $m_3/m_2^{3/2}$ and $m_4/m_2{^2}$ described
by @joanes1998, and used in SMM047 2025-26 [@gerrard_seg2_notes_questions].
These measures are widely used in textbooks and provide a direct description of
the shape of the empirical distribution.

Alternative software implementations, such as the package `summarytools`, were
considered. These packages apply small-sample bias corrections (“type 3”
estimators), which lead to slightly different values but are asymptotically
equivalent. Given our relatively large sample size and descriptive aim, the type
1 definitions are appropriate and fully adequate.

```{r Element 1 pt2}
# e1071::skewness(z_n_clean, type = 1)

z_n_clean_numeric <- as.numeric(z_n_clean)

desc <- tibble(
  Statistic = c(
    "Sample Mean",
    "Sample Variance",
    "Skewness (Type 1)",
    "Excess Kurtosis (Type 1)"
  ),
  Value = c(
    mean(z_n_clean_numeric),
    var(z_n_clean_numeric),
    e1071::skewness(z_n_clean_numeric, type = 1),
    # already excess kurtosis for type = 1
    e1071::kurtosis(z_n_clean_numeric, type = 1)
  )
) |>
  mutate(Value = sprintf("%.6f", Value))
```

```{r zn-desc, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
kable(
  desc,
  caption = "Descriptive statistics of cleaned log returns ($z_n$).",
  booktabs = TRUE,
  align = c("l", "r"),
  escape = FALSE
) |>
  kable_styling(full_width = FALSE, position = "center")
```

BE note: I have included a quick demo of this here:

```{r Element 1 pt3, echo=FALSE}
# e1071::skewness(z_n_clean, type = 1)

z_n_clean_numeric <- as.numeric(z_n_clean)

desc_ad <- tibble(
  Statistic = c(
    "Sample Mean",
    "Sample Variance",
    "Skewness (Type 1)",
    "Skewness (Type 2)",
    "Skewness (Type 3)",
    "Excess Kurtosis (Type 1)",
    "Excess Kurtosis (Type 2)",
    "Excess Kurtosis (Type 3)"
  ),
  Value = c(
    mean(z_n_clean_numeric),
    var(z_n_clean_numeric),
    e1071::skewness(z_n_clean_numeric, type = 1),
    e1071::skewness(z_n_clean_numeric, type = 2),
    e1071::skewness(z_n_clean_numeric, type = 3),
    # already excess kurtosis for type = 1
    e1071::kurtosis(z_n_clean_numeric, type = 1),
    e1071::kurtosis(z_n_clean_numeric, type = 2),
    e1071::kurtosis(z_n_clean_numeric, type = 3)
  )
) |>
  mutate(Value = sprintf("%.6f", Value))
```

```{r zn-desc-ad, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
kable(
  desc_ad,
  caption = "Additional descriptive statistics of cleaned log returns ($z_n$).",
  booktabs = TRUE,
  align = c("l", "r"),
  escape = FALSE
) |>
  kable_styling(full_width = FALSE, position = "center")
```

```{r Element 1 old summary tools, results = "asis", echo=FALSE}
#---------- Element 1: data cleaning and standard test of normality -----------#
summary_table <- descr(
  z_n_clean,
  stats = c("mean", "sd", "skewness", "kurtosis"),
  transpose = TRUE,
  headings = FALSE,
  round.digits = 6,
  plain.ascii = FALSE,
  style = "rmarkdown"
)
```

Output of `summarytools` (the technique introduced in the lab session).
Summarytools does not output the variance, but we can calculate by squaring the
standard deviation. Output from `summarytools` for variance is
`r formatC(summary_table$Std.Dev^2, format = "fg", digits = 4)` , compared to
`r formatC(var(z_n_clean_numeric), format = "fg", digits = 4)` from `e1071`.

```{r, results = "asis", echo=FALSE}
print(summary_table)
# summary_table$Std.Dev^2
# boxplot(z_n)


# # COVID: 10/04/2020-19/05/2020
#
# IXIC_ad <- IXIC_ad[
#   !((index(IXIC_ad) >= "2020-04-10") &
#     (index(IXIC_ad) <= "2020-05-19"))
# ]
#
#
# z_n = na.omit(log(IXIC_ad / dplyr::lag(IXIC_ad)))

# plot(z_n)
# boxplot(z_n)
```

_Note how the skewness and kurtosis from `summarytools` match the type 3
skewness and kurtosis from `e1071`._

### Test of normality {#elementOneAdtest}

Since the 1960's studies have found that asset returns (in particular, daily
log-returns) are leptokurtic, with a higher peak and heavier tails than the
normal distribution [@Mandelbrot1963; @Fama1965], and in 2001 the heavy tails of
financial were identified as being a "stylized empirical fact" by
@Cont01022001^[Where a 'stylized empirical fact' was defined as being
"properties common across a wide range of instruments, markets and time periods"
[@Cont01022001 pp. 224]]. The Anderson-Darling test was selected to test the
normality of these data as is it more sensitive to deviations in the tails of
the distribution.

<!-- Given that financial log-returns are widely theorised to be leptokurtic
("fat-tailed"), the Anderson-Darling test is a suitable test for detecting the
exact type of non-normality that is expected. -->

```{r Test of normality}
ad_test_result <- ad.test(z_n_clean)
ad_test_result
```

The null hypothesis ($H_0$) for the Anderson-Darling test is that the data is
normally distributed. The test yields a statistic of A =
`r round(ad_test_result$statistic, 1)` with a p-value of
`r formatC(ad_test_result$p.value, format = "e", digits = 2)`. We therefore
reject $H_0$ in favour of $H_1$. The Anderson-Darling test provides strong
evidence that the $z_n$ data are not normally distributed.

## Investigation of normality by resampling {#elementTwo}

### Instructions (to be removed later)

_You are going to investigate whether the difference between your sample and a
sample from a normal distribution becomes apparent when constructing confidence
intervals for sample skewness._

_(a) Simulate a sample of size 13 from a Normal distribution with mean and
variance equal to the sample mean and variance you have just calculated.
Calculate the sample skewness from this simulated sample. Repeat this until you
have generated 50,000 values of $\hat{\gamma}_1$._

_(b) Use resampling to obtain a sample of size 13 from your z-data. Calculate
the sample skewness from this bootstrap sample. Repeat this until you have
generated 50,000 values of $\hat{\gamma}_1$._

_(c) Use suitable illustrations to investigate the differences between the two
sets of $\hat{\gamma}$ values. Comment on what you observe and whether the
outcome of your tests confirms the result of the test of normality._

### Simulating skewness from a normal distribution

Idea: compare the sampling distribution of skewness from the data against the
sampling distribution of skewness from a true normal distribution, using the
parameters from IXIC data.

We are told to use a small n ($n=13$) so would expect non-normal despite
underlying data being normal.

```{r Element 2 pt1 - Simulating skewness from a normal distribution}
#---------- Element 2: investigation of normality by resampling -----------#
# set random seed
set.seed(1234)

# set parameters from z_data (mean & st-dev)
z_mean <- mean(z_n_clean)
z_sd <- sd(z_n_clean)
N_reps <- 50000
n_sample_size <- 13

# Simulate 50,000 skewness values using sample size of 13
skew_normal_sim <- replicate(
  N_reps, e1071::skewness(rnorm(n_sample_size, z_mean, z_sd), type = 1)
  )
```

### Resampling skewness from $z$-data using bootstrapping

Idea: repeat this process using bootstrapping and z-data.

Non-parametric bootstrap...

```{r Element 2 pt2 - Simulating skewness using bootstrapping}
# bootstrapping skewness simulation
skew_bootstrap <- replicate(
  N_reps, e1071::skewness(sample(z_n_clean, n_sample_size, replace = TRUE), type = 1)
  )
```

### Visual comparison and interpretation

An overlapping density plot was used to illustrate the differences between the
two skewness simulations.

```{r skewness-densities, fig.cap = paste0("Sampling distributions of the skewness estimator for ",N_reps, " samples of size n=", n_sample_size, " taken from a Normal model (blue) and from the empirical log-returns $z_n$ via bootstrap (red).")}

# bootstrapping skewness simulation
skew_df <- data.frame(
  skewness = c(skew_normal_sim, skew_bootstrap),
  Source   = factor(
    rep(c("Normal model", "Bootstrap from data"),
        each = N_reps)
  )
)

ggplot(skew_df, aes(x = skewness, fill = Source)) +
  geom_density(alpha = 0.4) +
  theme_bw() +
  labs(
    title = expression("Sampling distributions of " * hat(gamma) *
                       " for n = 13"),
    x     = expression(hat(gamma)),
    y     = "Density"
  )
```

As shown in Figure \@ref(fig:skewness-densities), the "Simulated Normal"
distribution is roughly centred on 0. The "Bootstrap Data" distribution is
slightly shifted to the left (lower than 0) (indicating the data's inherent
skew) and is it wider, with fatter tails.

The sampling distribution of skewness under the simulated Normal condition is
approximately centred at 0, as expected. The bootstrap distribution based on the
observed $z_{n}$ data is shifted to the left (mid-point <0), reflecting a
negative skew, and is noticeably more dispersed with heavier tails.

The small samples drawn from the empirical $z_n$ distribution tend to produce
more extreme and variable skewness values than one would expect under a normal
assumption with the same mean and variance, even accounting for the small sample
size. This observation is in agreement with the Anderson-Darling test
(&#167;\@ref(elementOneAdtest)) and provides further evidence against an
assumption of normality for these data.

## Investigation of constant mean {#elementThr}

### Instructions (to be removed later)

_Divide your $z$ data into 14 subsamples, each representing six months. (If your
data cleansing has removed all or most of one six-month period, just omit it
from this analysis.) Compare the means of your subsamples using an appropriate
illustration, supported by at least one statistical test. [Note that Analysis of
Variance (ANOVA) is based on an assumption of Normality: if you decide to use
ANOVA for your test you will need to comment on the Normality, or otherwise, of
your 7 subsamples.]_

### Visual comparison of means

Want to test second core assumption that the log-returns $z_n$ have a constant
mean $\mu$\dots

Want to use split() function to divide the data by time periods to create a list
of 14 xts objects, each representing a 6-month period

```{r Element 3 pt1 - TBC}
#---------- Element 3: investigation of constant mean -----------#
# split z data into 14 subsamples
z_list <- split(z_n_clean, f = "months", k = 6)

# drop values if all or most of 1 6M period have been removed
# BE note: have just removed fully blank values, but need to tweak this
z_list <- z_list[lengths(z_list) > 0]

combined_df_el3 <- bind_rows(lapply(seq_along(z_list), function(i) {
  data.frame(
    Period  = factor(names(z_list)[i], levels = names(z_list)),
    z_value = as.numeric(z_list[[i]])
  )
}))
```

```{r element3-boxplot, echo=FALSE}
ggplot(combined_df_el3, aes(x = Period, y = z_value)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  theme_bw() +
  labs(
    title = "Log-returns over six-month periods",
    x = "Six-month period",
    y = expression(z[n])
  ) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))
```

### Statistical test

```{r}
kruskal_res <- kruskal.test(z_value ~ Period, data = combined_df_el3)
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
kruskal_df <- data.frame(
  Test = "Kruskal–Wallis rank sum test",
  Df = kruskal_res$parameter,
  Statistic = unname(kruskal_res$statistic),
  p.value = kruskal_res$p.value
)

kruskal_df$Statistic <- sprintf("%.3f", kruskal_df$Statistic)
kruskal_df$p.value <- formatC(kruskal_df$p.value, format = "fg", digits = 4)
```

```{r kruskal-res, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
kable(
  kruskal_df,
  caption = "Kruskal–Wallis test outcome for differences in log-return distributions across six-month periods.",
  booktabs = TRUE,
  align = c("l", "r", "r", "r"),
  row.names = FALSE
) |>
  kable_styling(full_width = FALSE, position = "center")
```

From &#167;\@ref(elementOne) & \@ref(elementTwo) we know that our data cannot be
treated as being normally distributed/shows strong departures from Normality. We
therefore opted to use a non-parametric alternative to one-way ANOVA.

<!-- We therefore cannot use ANOVA testing as it is based upon an assumption of normality. -->

The Kruskal-Wallis test was used as a non-parametric alternative to one-way
ANOVA to compare the behaviour of $z_n$ across the six-month periods.

The Kruskal–Wallis test compares the distributions (equivalently, the mean
ranks) of the groups. Under the null hypothesis $H_0$, all groups share the same
distribution. If we assume similar spread and shape, this can be interpreted as
equality of medians (ref!).

This checks for differences in central tendency across groups and the null
hypothesis ($H_0$) is that the medians of all 14 groups are equal.

As shown in Table \@ref(tab:kruskal-res), there are no statistically significant
differences in the typical (central) log-return across the periods
(p=`r signif(kruskal_res$p.value, 3)`) and we do not have sufficient evidence to
reject $H_0$. This finding is consistent with the assumption of a constant mean
(or median) log-return over time.

## Investigation of constant variance {#elementFou}

### Instructions (to be removed later)

_Use the same subsamples as for Element 3. Use a suitable illustration to
compare the spread of your subsamples. Identify the six-month period with the
largest sample variance and the six-month period with the smallest sample
variance. Use bootstrapping/resampling to construct a 95% confidence interval
for $\sigma^2$ for each of these two subsamples separately. Comment on any
perceived overlap between these intervals._

### Identifying subsamples with max/min variance (chapter 4 in CS1)

```{r Element 4 pt1 - TBC}
#---------- Element 4: investigation of constant variance -----------#
variances <- sapply(z_list, var, na.rm = TRUE)
min_var_sample <- which.min(variances)
max_var_sample <- which.max(variances)
```

The six-month period with the largest sample variance is
`r names(z_list)[min_var_sample]` and the six-month period with the smallest
sample variance is `r names(z_list)[max_var_sample]`.

```{r element4-violin-bar, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.cap="Distributions and variability of cleaned log-returns across six-month periods. Top: violin and boxplot summaries of $z_n$ for each period. Bottom: corresponding sample variances $s^2$, highlighting relative differences in spread."}
# # Violin + boxplot for spread/shape

## Independence of increments {#elementFiv}

### Instructions (to be removed later)

_The Efficient Markets Hypothesis states that the price of an asset today
incorporates all the information which is available about the asset, and
therefore that any changes to the price between today and tomorrow will be based
on new, and unpredictable, information which arrives in the meantime. The
practical result of this is that $z_{n}$ should be independent of both $z_{n−1}$
and $y_{n−1}$ if the EMH is true.\_

_Test the independence of ${z_{n}}$ and ${z_{n-1}}$ by using a contingency table
procedure. Let $q_1$, $q_2$, $q_3$ represent the sample quartiles of the $z$
data. Classify each of the $z_n$ observations according to whether it is less
than q1, between $q_1$ and $q_2$, between $q_2$ and $q_3$, or greater than
$q_3$. Now draw up the contingency table to determine whether the classification
of $z_{n}$ is dependent on the classiﬁcation of $z_{n−1}$.\_

## General upwardness of trend {#elementSix}

### Instructions (to be removed later)

_One aspect of the data which might reflect a general tendency for the index to
increase might be the proportion of days when the price increment is positive.
Test whether this proportion is greater than 0.5._

_Another aspect is the persistence of trends. A “positive run” is a sequence of
consecutive days when $Z_i > 0$; a “negative run” is a sequence of consecutive
days when $Z_i < 0$. (Note that a run may only be one day in length, or may be
longer than one day.) Identify the runs in your data set and test whether
positive runs have longer mean duration than negative runs. _

# Conclusions

While the log-normal model was invalidated by the data's non-normality
(&#167;\@ref(elementOne) & &#167;\@ref(elementTwo)), non-constant variance
(&#167;\@ref(elementFou)), and lack of independence ((&#167;\@ref(elementFiv)),
your analysis for &#167;\@ref(elementThr) did not find statistical evidence to
reject the assumption of a constant mean.

To be updated:

Based on the Kruskal-Wallis Test the mean log-return appears to be constant over
time, even as the other core assumptions are violated.

!BE note: check to see if the other assumptions in 4-6 are violated...

## Generative AI Declaration

Generative AI tools were used to assist with project planning and methodological
validation throughout this project.

### Tools Used

Google Gemini 2.5 Pro (Deep Research), ChatGPT 5

### Prompts used

The GenAI tools were provided with the 'Coursework Group 7.pdf' and extracts
from our R code.

A non-exhaustive list of prompts/queries used is shown below. We opted to
include at least one example of each _type_ of query used, rather than including
all queries used. For example, if we entered the prompts/queries 'How can we put
two ggplots side by side?' and 'How to remove grey background on a ggplot', we
would only include the first of these in the list below, as both relate to
plotting issues (& are similar to querying with a traditional search engine).

- "Can you help with outlining the steps for this project."
- "...the top of both graphs in r are slightly different. (Pasting in R code.)
  Can this be fixed for the plot area?"
- ...

### Use of GenAI output

The GenAI tools served as a additional group member. Notably, the GenAI output:

- Helped debug plotting issues.
- Raised potential statistical traps (e.g., the "ANOVA trap" and the "data
  cleansing order" trap).
- Suggested appropriate non-parametric tests (Kruskal-Wallis, Wilcoxon Rank-Sum)
  where the assumptions of parametric tests (ANOVA, t-test) were violated.
- Recommended specific R packages (nortest, e1071) and functions (ad.test,
  kruskal.test) best suited for each task.
- Commented on the structure for the R code and the final report narrative.

### Changes made following GenAI use:

The AI's suggestions were critically reviewed and debated by the group. Plotting
formatting in ggplot, ... (add others) and... were all implemented following an
iterative feedback cycle.

The R code for implementation was written and debugged by the group. GenAI tools
were used, and thought of, in the capacity of an additional group member. All
final analysis, interpretation, and writing in this report were generated by
(human) group members.
